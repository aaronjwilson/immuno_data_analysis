Hoping to have a reference to show the evolution of the code and coding skills.

The ELISA work has become something that i like and enjoy, but there are constant improvements to the code that need to be done as packages upgrade or logic changes necessitate a re-thinking of the whole workflow. The original method still stands in that DRC is a great and versatile package. Munging the data into the format necessary to work with has changed. while now i do everything in R specifically with an accordian style of data reshape, I would previously setup datasets using [nested SQL queries](https://github.com/aaronjwilson/immuno_data_analysis/blob/master/data/SQL.sql) and push that data to an [R script](https://github.com/aaronjwilson/immuno_data_analysis/blob/master/data/drc.R) to do more to get the final result.<br>

The same process exists for [ELISpot analysis](https://github.com/aaronjwilson/immuno_data_analysis/blob/master/TimeCapsules.md#:~:text=Trucount.R-,elispot,-.md) and some flow cytometry phenotyping panel work.


It is nice to see the skill and mental processes change over time but it is good to know that the packages are constantly changing too.
